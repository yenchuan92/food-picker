# Welcome to the Food Picker App!

Frontend (created with Create React App) uses React and Axios.
Backend uses NodeJS and Express.
Currently there is no backend since the requirements didn't call for one(if needed, can setup one using mongoose and MongoDB to persist the data).

# Setting up

1. Make sure you have npm installed, otherwise go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and download then install it.
2. Once done, download or pull the code from github.
3. Open a command prompt inside the food-picker-backend folder.
4. Run the command "npm install" to install the packages.
5. Next, Open a command prompt inside the food-picker-frontend folder.
6. Run the command "npm install" to install the packages.
7. Run the command "npm start" inside both the food-picker-backend and food-picker-frontend folders.
8. You can then test the application on http://localhost:3000/

Note that the data will not persist since there is no database linked, every time the backend server restarts, the data will be wiped.
